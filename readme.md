	that will be visible to the user/customers such as _ the order page in which the customers will place 
	their orders,the view page in which customers can keep track on the order they placed, the update page
	in which the customer can make the changes to thier orders, the cancel page in which customers can cancel 
	their order and the profile page in which customers can edit their order._

	administrators, but differs in the aspect that the super administrator will be the only one who will be
	able to add other administrators to the system.
